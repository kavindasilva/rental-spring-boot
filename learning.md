# Learning Outcomes
Following are the learning outcomes related with hibernate and spring boot

* Architecture reference [Spring Boot Flow Architecture](https://static.javatpoint.com/springboot/images/spring-boot-architecture2.png)
* Old repo [github link](https://github.com/kavindasilva/java-crud/)


## Keywords

* @Controller indicates that a particular class serves the role of a controller. The dispatcher scans such annotated classes for mapped methods and detects @RequestMapping annotations
* @RestController is a specialized version of the controller. It includes the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations
* @RequestMapping is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods
* @PathVariable
* @GetMapping
* @PostMapping
* @RequestBody

* @Autowired annotation can be used to autowire bean on constructor, a property or methods. It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into our bean
* @Qualifier is used to indicate the required bean, when there are multiple beans.

* @Service
* @RequestBody
* @Configuration
* @EJBConfiguration
* @Transactional

## Comparisons

* @Resource means get me a known resource by name. The name is extracted from the name of the annotated setter or field, or it is taken from the name-Parameter.
  @Inject or @Autowired try to wire in a suitable other component by type. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10916767)
